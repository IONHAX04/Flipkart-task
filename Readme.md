Project Flipkart
Instructions
● HTML, JS, CSS, and PHP code should be in separate files, none of the codes must co-exist in the same file.
● Only use Jquery AJAX for interacting with the backend (strictly no usage of form submission).
● CSS can be used but the form must be designed in bootstrap in order to maintain page responsiveness.
● Use MySql for storing the registered data and MongoDB for Storing the details of the user profiles
● In MySQL always use Prepared Statements, with no usage of simple SQL statements.
● The login session should be maintained only using browser localstorage (Do not use PHP Session)
● Use Redis to store the session information in the backend.
